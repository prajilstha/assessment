# Assesment

I have used 32 bit ActiveState Perl. So, if you are using 64 bit Perl then, please change the code #!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT in .pl file to 
#!C:\Perl64\bin\perl.exe -wT

Basic useful feature list:

 * Click New button to add appointment.
 * Search appoinments.
 

Please change the URL in insertData.pl

```javascript
#AUTO RE-DIRECT AFTER DATA ENTRY
my $url="http://localhost:8081/assessment/index.html";
```
I have also attached screenshots.
